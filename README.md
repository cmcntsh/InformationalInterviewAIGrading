# Informational Interview AI Grading

This is a collection of resources and prompts for evaluating and grading student informational interview papers. https://utah.instructure.com/courses/934121/assignments/13311169 The original sources for the content areas come from https://theinterviewguys.com/informational-interview-questions-included/ and https://theinterviewguys.com/top-14-questions-to-ask-in-an-interview/ . I have tried some of these on ChatGPT https://chat.openai.com/ and Google Bard https://bard.google.com/chat . (I think ChatGPT may be a bit better right now, but both systems experience periodic updates, so that may change or vary with time.) Disclaimer: I have tried these prompts, and they seem to yield acceptable results. These may not be the only suitable prompts or even the best prompts. If you know or find better prompts for a particular writing task, I'd love to hear about them.

* General writing advice https://github.com/cmcntsh/PoWeRWritingGradStudents
* Highlighting and feedback conventions https://github.com/cmcntsh/PoWeRWritingGradStudents#highlighting
* At a minimum, I would strongly encourage students to run the copyediting prompt before submitting their work. It would be nice if they would also run the substantive editing prompt and address any gaps before submitting. It would also be nice if they would review their paragraphs for strong main topics and suitable organization.

## Use Prompts to Edit Your Writing

I would use the following prompts on individual sections of your paper and not the entire paper all at once. I would use each prompt individually, evaluate the suggested changes, and update your text as desired before moving to the next prompt. I would then use your revised text as the starting point for the next editing prompt.
